xvfb.conf sets up a virtual framebuffer at DISPLAY :10. this will be useful for test that requires DISPLAY, such as selenium_examples, and rails_examples if the JS driver is set to any real browser.
sudo cp xvfb.conf /etc/init
the Xvfb process should run the next time the system is rebooted.
To manually control this serivce:
sudo service xvfb start
sudo service xvfb stop

don't forget to export DISPLAY=:10
put this line to the .bash_profile of jenkins, which will allow CI to use DISPLAY :10.
